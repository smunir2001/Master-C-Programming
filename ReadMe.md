## Important Notes
Overview of C --> efficient, portable, power and flexibility, programmer oriented.

Language features --> imperative language, top-down planning, structured programming and modular design.
### Fundamentals of a program
Computers are very dumb machines: they only do what they are told to do!

The basic operations of a computer will form what is known as the computer's instruction set.

To solve a problem using a computer, you must provide a solution to the problem by sending instructions to the instruction set.
* a computer program sends the instructions necessary to solve a specific problem.
The approach or method that is used to solve the problem is known as an algorithm.
* The statements that solve the problem becomes the prgram.
* The method that is used to solve the problem is the algorithm.
To write a program, you need to write the instructions necessary to implement the algorithm.
* These instructions would be expressed in the statements of a particular computer language, such as Java, C++, Objective-C, or C.
### Terminology
CPU (central processing unit)
* does most of the computing work
* instructions are executed here

RAM (random access memory)
* stores the date of a program while it is running

Hard drive (permanent storage)
* stores files that contain program source code, even while the computer is turned off

Operating system
* developed to help make it more convenient to use computers
* a program that controls the entire operation of a computer
    * all input/output
    * manages the computer's resources and handles the execution of programs
    * Windows, Unix, Android, iOS, etc

Fetch/execute cycle (life of a CPU)
* fetches an instruction from memory (using registers) and executes it (loop)
* a gigahertz CPU can do this about a billion times a second

Higher-level programming language
* high-level programming languages make it easier to write programs
    * opposite of assembly language
    * C is a higher-level programming language that describes actions in a more abstract form
    * the instructions (statements) of a program look more like problem solving steps
    * do not have to worry about the precise steps a particular CPU would have to take to accomplish a particular task

Compilers
* a program that translates high-level langauge source code into the detailed set of machine language instructions the computer requires
* the program does high-level thinking and the compiler generates tedious instructions to the CPU
* compilers will also check that your program has valid syntax for the programming language that you are compiling
    * finds errors and it reports them to you and does not produce an executable until you fix them
* high-level languages are easier to learn and much easier to program in that are machine lanaguages

Writing a program
* the act of writing a C program can be broken down into multiple steps
1. Define the program objectives
    * understand the requirements of the problem
    * get a clear idea of what you want the program to accomplish
2. Design the program
    * decide how the program will meet the above requirements
    * what should the user interface be like?
    * how should the program be organized?
3. Write the code
    * start implementation, translate the design in the syntax of C
    * you need to use a text editor to create what is called a *source code* file
4. Compile
    * translate the source code into machine code (executable code)
    * consists of detailed instructions to the CPU expressed in numeric code
5. Run the program
    * the executable file is a program you can run
6. Test/debug the pgoram
    * just because a program is running, does not mean it works as intended
    * need to test, to see that your program does what it is supposed to do (may find bugs)
        * debugging is the process of finding and fixing program errors
        * making mistakes is a natural part of learning
7. Maintain/modify the program
    * programs are released and used by many people
    * have to continue to fix new bugs or add new features
